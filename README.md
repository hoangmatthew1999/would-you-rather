### Getting this App up and running is simple:

1.  clone the repository using <code>git clone https://github.com/iwakoscott/would-you-rather.git</code>
2.  run <code>npm install</code> to download all dependencies to your machine.
3.  run <code>npm start</code> to start development server and the app should open in a browser. If not, you can navigate to <code>localhost:3000</code> and the App should appear.

**Note to user: If you are not a Udacity grader you unfortunately can't play with the deployed App ☹️**
